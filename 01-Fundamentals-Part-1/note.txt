    NaN:  
    Js give us this, NaN value whenever an operation that involves numbers fails to produce a new number. 
    So basicallynot a number actually means invalid number.


    Js can on;y convert two, three types.
    So you can convert a number to a string or a boolean
    But we can't convert something to undefined or to no.
